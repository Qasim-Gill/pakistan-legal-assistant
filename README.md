# **Pakistan Legal Assistant üáµüá∞**

## **About the Project**
The **Pakistan Legal Assistant** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer queries related to Pakistani laws. It provides accurate, detailed, and multilingual responses in **English** and **Urdu**, making legal information accessible to everyone.

This project was developed as part of the **ULEFUSA - APTECH Generative AI Training Hackathon (Jan-Feb 2025)**.

---

## **Features**
- **Multilingual Support**: Answers legal questions in both **English** and **Urdu**.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Retrieves relevant legal documents and provides structured answers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive chat interface powered by **Gradio**.
- **Fast and Accurate**: Uses state-of-the-art AI models for quick and reliable responses.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **User Query**: The user asks a legal question in English or Urdu.
2. **Language Detection**: The system detects the language of the query.
3. **Document Retrieval**: Relevant legal documents are retrieved from a vector store.
4. **Response Generation**: The system generates a detailed and structured response in the same language as the query.
5. **Output Delivery**: The response is displayed in the chat interface.
